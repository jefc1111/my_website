# Radio Tracker

Shows the most recent ten songs playing on BBC 6 Music and adds a button next to each which records a recommendation. 

This was mainly conceived so that when I am cooking or whatever and hear a song I like on BBC 6 Music I 
can easily make a note of such. Then later on when I'm not cooking or whatever I can see if thete was anything
new I heard on the radio recently that I liked. 

I also wanted a little project I could use as a way of learning some more Elixir / Phoenix Framework (https://www.phoenixframework.org/).

## Possible extra features
- Ability to leave a note with a recommendation.
- The page to see 'recent recommendations' and similar 'top 10s'.
- Ability to undo a recommendation immediately after making it.
- User accounts. Allow registered users to have their own page. Then we get overall aggregated 'most recommended' stats and so on.
