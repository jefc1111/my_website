# Radio Tracker

Shows the most recent ten songs playing on BBC 6 Music and adds a button next to each which records a recommendation. 

This was mainly conceived so that when I am cooking or whatever and hear a song I like on BBC 6 Music I 
can easily record that. Then later on when I'm not cooking or whatever I can see if thete was anything
new I heard on the radio recently that I liked. 

I also wanted a little project I could use as a way of learning some more Elixir / Phoenix Framework (https://www.phoenixframework.org/).
